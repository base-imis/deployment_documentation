# Deployment Documentation  

This repository includes all the resources required to deploy the **Base IMIS** application for a new city, including essential documentation, configuration files, and database backups. The deployment process is supported by three key components:  

- [**Deployment Manual**](#): A detailed guide outlining the step-by-step process to ensure a smooth and efficient IMIS deployment. Two manuals are available, one for production on Linux- Ubuntu OS and one for development on Windows OS.  
- [**Docker Configuration**](#): A folder containing all the necessary files and directories for the Docker-Compose setup, enabling the deployment of the IMIS web application.  
- [**Blank Database**](#): A backup of the blank IMIS database to initialize a new instance with the required database structure.  

These resources ensure a seamless and standardized deployment of IMIS across different municipalities.
